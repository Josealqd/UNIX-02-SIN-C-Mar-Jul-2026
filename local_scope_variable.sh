#What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable? And what are the specific characteristics of calling functions in Bash?
#1. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GLOBAL AND LOCAL VARIABLES?

# Global Variables: These are available to the entire program from anywhere. 
#   For example, 'PUBLISHER' below can be accessed inside or outside functions.
# Local Variables: These are locked down. By using the 'local' keyword, you restrict 
#   the variable so it's only accessible from within that specific block of code. 
#   If you try to call a local variable outside its function, it just returns empty 
#   because the rest of the script has no idea it exists.

# 2. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH FUNCTION INVOCATION IN BASH?
#  When you invoke a function (like calling 'print_name' below), Bash executes 
#   the code block and processes any local variables defined inside it. 
#   The big catch here is that once the function finishes running, those local 
#   variables lose their scope entirely. So, any command outside the function 
#   trying to use that local data will just get a blank space.
